# Lets-Go-Functional-Java

Welcome to my lessons on Functional Programming<br>
Lambda Expressions and Streams, opens up a whole new style of programming in Java. It makes us rethink the style in which we approach problems.<br>
This is my small attempt to learn and maybe help other fellow programmers along the way learn about streams and its advantages in Java

# About the repo
1) Each of the Java files is addressed to deal with a specific feature.<br>
2) Also each file will have a commented piece of code at top, which explains about that lesson<br>
3) Some lessons will have a part of the code commented out, this usually corresponds to an alternative approach or an iterative way to solve a given problem

# How you can make the best of this repo?
1) Compile the program and have a look at the output first<br>
2) Then read the description above the main() method<br>
3) Then walk through the code reading the comments and running the code as needed<br>
4) Feel free to modify the code and clear any curious doubts that may arise<br>
